<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this thesis, an effective vision-based system is proposed to accurately track a robot's true position and orientation using an overhead camera attached to the robot and looking on the ceiling. The ground truth is the Vicon system which is a motion capture system. The robot used in the experiment is TurtleBot, which is a low-cost, personal robot kit with open-source software. The selection of suitable visual features and methods is necessary to achieve efficient results. A map of features is created, and a localization algorithm is implemented to locate the robot. The ceiling is chosen as a reference for the algorithm because it is the most stable part of any indoor environment. The camera is chosen in localization because it is the most flexible and low cost approach.
